This project involves building a data management and visualization system for Raksha Pipes. The system includes generating realistic data, designing a MySQL database, and creating an interactive dashboard using Power BI. The aim is to provide valuable insights to help Raksha Pipes make informed business decisions. 

1. Generate Data and Design Database
Generate Data
I used the faker library in Python to generate realistic data for the following tables:

Product: Information about the products sold by Raksha Pipes.
Customer: Details of the customers purchasing the products.
Order: Information on customer orders.
Shipper: Details of the shipping companies delivering the products.
Review: Customer reviews of the products.
OrderDetails: Detailed information about each order.
Payment: Payment details for the orders.
The data generation script can be found in the data_generation.py file.

Design Database
Designed a MySQL database schema with the following interconnected tables to avoid redundancy and ensure data integrity:
Product
Customer
Order
Shipper
Review
OrderDetails
Payment

2. mysql Creating Schema

The generated data was used to populate the designed MySQL database. SQL scripts were created to build the database schema and insert the data.

3. Power-BI Dashboard (Power BI)
Created an interactive dashboard is in Power BI to visualize key business metrics. The dashboard connects to the MySQL database and displays:

Sales Trends: Visualizations showing sales over time.
Product Performance: Insights into how different products are performing.
Customer Profiles: Information on customer demographics and buying patterns.
